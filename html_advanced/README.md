# Advanced HTML - Techium

## Overview
Welcome to the Techium project! This project focuses on the use of HTML tags to structure a webpage. The objective is to master the use of semantic HTML5 elements to create a structured and accessible web page. No styling will be applied in this phase, so the final output will focus purely on the structure.

## Objectives
- Understand and apply HTML5 semantic tags
- Create a structured web page skeleton
- Use elements like `nav`, `header`, `footer`, `main`, `section`, and `aside` appropriately
- Differentiate between `div` and `span` use cases
- Implement tables, forms, and media (`<img>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>`) within a web page
- Embed external content using `<iframe>`
- Organize content in lists and link to different sections of the webpage or external resources

## Key Concepts
- Semantic HTML
- HTML5 Structure
- Embedding Media
- Creating Forms
- Navigation Links
- Data Tables
- Accessibility

## Requirements
- A README.md file at the root of the project directory
- Use of semantic HTML5 tags
- W3C compliant HTML code
- Proper structure of HTML elements according to their semantic meaning
- Usage of comments to segment the code for better readability

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The homepage of the Techium project featuring sections like Header, Services, Works, Latest News, Testimonials, and Contact.
- `about.html`, `latest_news.html`, `contact.html`: Additional pages linked from the homepage.
- `styleguide.html`: A page that documents various HTML elements used in the project, including typography, tables, forms, and embedded content.

## Implementation Details
- **Header**: Utilizes the `<header>` tag, includes navigation links.
- **Navigation**: The `<nav>` element contains links to different sections of the website or external pages.
- **Main Content**: Structured using `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` tags to define thematic grouping of content.
- **Media Elements**: Incorporate `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>` tags to embed media.
- **Forms**: Demonstrate the use of `<form>`, `<input>`, and related tags to create interactive forms.
- **Tables**: Use `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` for displaying tabular data.
- **Footer**: Contains contact information, social media links, and additional navigation within the `<footer>` tag.

## Best Practices
- Ensure all images have alt attributes for accessibility.
- Use proper headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) hierarchy for SEO and accessibility.
- Include `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag to define the language of the document.
- Apply `meta` tags in the `<head>` for character set, viewport settings, and description of the page.
